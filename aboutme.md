My name is K M Ibrahim Asif. I am a Electrical Systems Engineer at Halla Mechatronics. I am also pursuing a PhD in Computer Science from Mississippi State University. I like to identify myself as a Developer/Engineer, a Researcher, and last but not least as a Gamer. When I am not performing as one of these roles, I spend that time with my family.

I currently live in Saginaw, Michigan. My hometown is Dhaka, Bangladesh. I have a Masters degree in Computer Science. I am enthusiast about all things Computer Science, specially AI (Artifical Intelligence), and HCI (Human Computer Interaction). Python is my preferred programming language, but I am comfortable writing codes in C, C++, Java, and C# as well.

I occassionally play video games on my Xbox One and PC. FIFA 20 and Civilization VI are my go to titles for now. If you are up for a game of FIFA, hit me up on Xbox One (Gamer Tag: kia6765).
